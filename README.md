## Machine Learning Project --- Credit Score Prediction for Credit Card Application Approval.
This model is able to predict applicants' credit score based on their personal information.

## Dataset Description
Please find the raw data sets in the zipped file. One of the excel in the file includes applicants' personal information and the other excel file includes their previous credit score. These 2 excels can be connected by applicants'ID. 

## The entire model is composed of the following parts:
1. Importing data.
2. Data cleaning and data consolidation.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Weight of evidence and information value).
4. Applying and comparing 4 different machine learning models (XGB, LR, RF, SVC).
5. Conducting hyperparameter tuning for XGBoost.
6. Final Performance Evalaution.

## Powerpoint
The powerpoint includes the project details and performance.
